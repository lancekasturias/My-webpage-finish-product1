League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, the game follows a freemium model. The game was released on October 27, 2009. An abridged version of the game called League of Legends: Wild Rift for mobile and console, was announced on October 15, 2019.
In League of Legends, players assume the role of a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other player- or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures, although other distinct game modes exist as well with varying objectives, rules, and maps. Champions span a variety of roles and blend a variety of fantasy tropes, tied to a fictional universe developed by Riot Games through short stories, comics, cinematics, and books.
League of Legends was well received upon its release, earning praise for its diverse artistic and musical departments, particularly for its character design and production value. By July 2012, it was the most played PC game in North America and Europe in terms of the number of hours played. League has large footprint in streaming media communities on platforms such as YouTube and Twitch; it routinely ranks first in the most-watched hours. In September 2016, Riot Games estimated that there are over 100 million active players each month, and in September 2019,
 the company revealed that the game boasts nearly 8 million peak concurrent users each day.
The game's popularity has led it to expand into merchandise, with toys, accessories, and apparel,
 as well as additional tie-ins to other media through music videos, web series, and documentaries.
 Various in-game champions comprise three distinct virtual music groups that have earned significant real-world attention: Pentakill, a heavy metal band, K/DA, a K-pop girl group, 
 and True Damage, a hip hop group. League of Legends has an active and widespread competitive scene, which is commonly described as the preeminent global esport and a major factor towards the industry's legitimization. In North America and Europe, Riot Games organizes the League Championship Series (LCS), located in Los Angeles and the League of Legends European Championship (LEC), located in Berlin, respectively, each of which consist of 10 professional teams. These competitions culminate with the annual World Championship.
 The 2019 League of Legends World Championship had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million, with a minimum prize pool of US$2.5 million.
